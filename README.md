# Longitudinal-Dynamics-Model
This project simulates the longitudinal motion of a vehicle under varying throttle and braking inputs.
It uses a physics-based approach to model:
- Aerodynamic drag force as a function of velocity.
- Rolling resistance based on vehicle mass.
- Engine and braking forces applied dynamically over time.

The simulation provides insights into how a vehicle's velocity evolves under different driving conditions, with visualisations of the results.
